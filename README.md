Hi, I'm Ridho! ðŸ‘‹

An **Engineer** with **Design** expertise and an **Entrepreneurial spirit**, I'm always eager to explore new concepts and challenge conventional thinking. My professional life revolves around spearheading business strategy and development at [Raizora](https://raizora.com), while also guiding frontend development at [Red Ant Colony](https://redantcolony.com). My free time revolves around books, culinary adventures, strategic board games, or meaningful connections with cherished companions.
